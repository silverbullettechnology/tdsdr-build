/** Find a leaf filename in a colon-separated path list and return a full path
 *
 *  This tries a leaf filename against each element in a colon-separated path string,
 *  producing a full path and stat() it.  If the stat indicates the file exists, the full
 *  path is returned.  If the leaf file doesn't exist in any of the path components,
 *  returns NULL and sets errno to ENOENT.

 *  If search is NULL or empty, the current directory is searched.
 *
 *  If dst is not given, a static buffer of PATH_MAX bytes is used and returned.

 *  \param  search  Path list to search
 *  \param  leaf    Leaf filename to search
